# DICOM SRO Import/Export

The DicomSroExport module enables exporting DICOM SRO to local storage. The module has a basic UI that allows selecting a fixed image (source in Dicom term), a moving image (registered in Dicom term) and a transform node.
Transform node object can be created in the Transform module or Brainsfit and Plastimatch registration modules. See that page for further instructions.
